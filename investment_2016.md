# Analysis of SQL Query for "Valid TIVs" Problem

## 🧠 Problem Summary

We are given a table `Insurance` with the following columns:

- `pid` (Primary Key) – unique for each policy
- `tiv_2015` – total investment value in 2015
- `tiv_2016` – total investment value in 2016
- `lat` – latitude of policyholder’s city (not null)
- `lon` – longitude of policyholder’s city (not null)

### ✅ Task:
Report the **sum of all `tiv_2016` values** for policyholders who:
1. Have the **same `tiv_2015`** as **one or more other policyholders**
2. Have a **unique `(lat, lon)` pair** — i.e., no one else lives in the same city.

Round the final result to **two decimal places**.

## ❌ Original Attempted Query

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM (
    SELECT SUM(tiv_2016) AS tiv_2016 
    FROM (
        SELECT * 
        FROM Insurance
        GROUP BY lat, lon
        HAVING COUNT(lat) = 1
    ) AS t1
    GROUP BY t1.tiv_2015
    HAVING COUNT(t1.tiv_2015) > 1
) AS t2;
🔍 Mistakes in This Query:
Issue	Explanation
❌ GROUP BY lat, lon	This collapses multiple rows into one per (lat, lon), losing pid granularity
❌ HAVING COUNT(lat) = 1	Always returns 1 per group, so it doesn’t correctly filter unique locations
❌ SELECT * with GROUP BY	Not valid in strict SQL — non-grouped columns may be arbitrary
❌ Aggregation too early	Grouping before filtering by tiv_2015 duplicates distorts results
❌ Partial logic	The intersection of two conditions isn’t enforced on original rows

✅ Correct Solution (LeetCode-Validated)
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
    SELECT tiv_2015
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY tiv_2015
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND (lat, lon) IN (
    SELECT lat, lon
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY lat, lon
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
);
✅ Why This Works:
Filters the original Insurance rows directly (preserving pid)

Ensures:

tiv_2015 occurs more than once

(lat, lon) is unique across the entire table

Clean and readable, using subqueries for filtering

Fully compliant with SQL standards

🧪 Example Test Case
sql
Copy
Edit
| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat  | lon  |
|-----|----------|----------|------|------|
| 1   | 10       | 5.0      | 1.1  | 2.2  |
| 2   | 10       | 7.0      | 3.3  | 4.4  |
| 3   | 20       | 6.0      | 1.1  | 2.2  |
| 4   | 30       | 8.0      | 5.5  | 6.6  |
✅ Only pid = 2 qualifies:

tiv_2015 = 10 (duplicated)

(lat, lon) = (3.3, 4.4) (unique)

Output: tiv_2016 = 7.00

🔧 How to Improve:
Avoid using SELECT * with GROUP BY — always aggregate or specify columns explicitly.

Don’t group early if you still need row-level filtering.

Use subqueries to isolate row-level filters like “unique” or “duplicate” conditions.

Test with edge cases where:

One column has duplicates but the other does not

Multiple policies share a location

All coordinates are unique but tiv_2015 is not

✅ Better Version Using Same Nested Structure (Optional)
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM Insurance
    WHERE (lat, lon) IN (
        SELECT lat, lon
        FROM Insurance
        GROUP BY lat, lon
        HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
    )
    AND tiv_2015 IN (
        SELECT tiv_2015
        FROM Insurance
        GROUP BY tiv_2015
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    )
) AS filtered;
✅ Same logic, different structure — avoids incorrect grouping, works properly.

📌 Conclusion
Even though the original logic seemed intuitive, the misuse of GROUP BY and early aggregation caused row-level conditions to break down.
 Always preserve row granularity when filtering based on conditions across the whole dataset

    ## tip
donot make query nested too much if and is possible and break problem in parts and combine
